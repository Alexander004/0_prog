**Data**: Index of democracy of the Russian regions for 2006-2010 composed by the experts of the Moscow Carnegie Center N. V. Petrov and A. S. Titkov

```

### Correlate the electoral results of incumbents with the percentage of rural population in the region

#### Test the data for parametricity

```{r}
shapiro.test(Governor) 
shapiro.test(Country) 
var.test(Governor, Country)
```

**Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient for the variables** `Democracy_Index` **and** `Country` **and test its significance**

```{r}

cor.test(Country, Governor) #H0: the significance of the correlation coefficient equals 0 (= no correlation)
cor.test(Country, Governor, method = "pearson")#the same output
```

## Task 2. Spearman correlation

### Correlate the electoral results of United Russia in 2011 with the regions' index of democracy

#### Test the data for parametricity

```{r}

shapiro.test(UR_vote2011) 
shapiro.test(Democracy_Index) 
var.test(UR_vote2011, Democracy_Index)
```

**Calculate Spearman correlation coefficient for the variables** `UR_vote2011` **and** `Democracy_Index` **and test its significance**

```{r}

cor.test(UR_vote2011, Democracy_Index, method = "spearman")
```

## **Task 3. Correlation matrix**

#### **Prepare the data for correlation matrix**

```{r}

seminar_7_data<-data.frame(UR_vote2011, Russian, Country, Democracy_Index, Governor)

seminar_7_data
```

#### **Basic correlation matrix**

```{r}

seminar_7_cor_matrix<-cor(seminar_7_data)
seminar_7_cor_matrix
```

#### **Nice correlation matrix 1**

```{r}
##install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
ggpairs(seminar_7_data)
```

#### **Nice correlation matrix 2**

```{r}
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(seminar_7_cor_matrix, order = "hclust")# "hclust" = hierarchical clustering order 

corrplot(seminar_7_cor_matrix, order = "alphabet")# alternative: e.g. alphabet
corrplot(seminar_7_cor_matrix, order = "hclust", tl.col="black")#tl.col = change the text label color
```

#### **Remove statistically insignificant correlation coefficients from a correlation matrix**

```{r}

corrplot(seminar_7_cor_matrix, type="upper", order="hclust", tl.col = "black", p.mat = seminar_7_cor_matrix, sig.level = 0.05, insig = "blank")
#type="upper": display only the upper triangular of the correlation matrix, insig = "blank": insignificant correlations at the given level of significance will be removed
```

## **Practice. Protest correlations**

1.  Import the dataset `data2012_mneniye.csv`

```{r}
library(readr)
data2012_mneniye <- read_delim("~/0_HSE_study/колы/6/Data/data2012_mneniye.csv", 
    delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
data2012_mneniye
```
2.  Filter only the following variables: `Gender`, `Age`, `Satisfaction`, `Protest` and `Education`

```{r}
df <- data2012_mneniye %>% select(`Gender`, `Age`, `Satisfaction`, `Protest`, `Education`) %>% slice(36:96)
df
```
3.  Filter the following range of values for these variables: lines 36-96


4.  Create 5 vectors containing the numeric data from the respective variables

```{r}
gender_vector <- as.numeric(df$Gender)
age_vector <- as.numeric(df$Age)
satisfaction_vector <- as.numeric(df$Satisfaction)
protest_vector <- as.numeric(df$Protest)
education_vector <- as.numeric(df$Education)
```


5.  Construct paired correlations: `Gender-Protest`, `Age-Protest`, `Satisfaction-Protest`, `Education-Protest`

```{r}
shapiro.test(gender_vector) #p-value = 1.678e-11
shapiro.test(protest_vector) #p-value = 1.276e-11
var.test(gender_vector, protest_vector) #p-value = 0.9348
### Not parametric
```
```{r}
shapiro.test(age_vector) 
shapiro.test(protest_vector) 
var.test(age_vector, protest_vector)
# Not parametric
```
```{r}
shapiro.test(satisfaction_vector) 
shapiro.test(protest_vector) 
var.test(satisfaction_vector, protest_vector)
# Not parametric
```
```{r}
shapiro.test(education_vector) 
shapiro.test(protest_vector) 
var.test(education_vector, protest_vector)
# Not parametric
```


**NB!** In order to determine the appropriate type of correlation (Pearson or Spearman), it is necessary to carry out tests for parametricity

6.  Check the significance of correlation coefficients for each pair

```{r}
cor.test(gender_vector, protest_vector, method = "spearman") #p-value = 0.8147
cor.test(age_vector, protest_vector, method = "spearman") #p-value = 0.08457
cor.test(satisfaction_vector, protest_vector, method = "spearman") #p-value = 0.8413
cor.test(education_vector, protest_vector, method = "spearman") #p-value = 0.3542
```

7.  Create a correlation matrix using `corrplot()`

```{r}
a_cor <- cor(df)
corrplot(a_cor, order = "hclust")
```

8.  Remove statistically insignificant (at p = 0.05) correlation coefficients from the correlation matrix

```{r}
ggpairs(df)
```
