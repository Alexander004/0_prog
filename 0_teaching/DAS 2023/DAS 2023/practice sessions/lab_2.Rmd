# Practice 2: Chi-Square Test of Independence {.tabset}

## Problem 1 

In the first problem you will be using the 6th round of ESS. The dataset is available in data folder at bit.do/das2023

You sit down to explore a few variables and run a chi-square test.

```{r ESS data}
library(foreign)
library(haven)
ESS <- read_sav("~/0_teaching/DAS 2023/DAS 2023/data/ESS6e02_4.sav")
ESS
```

Select those who were born in the United Kingdom (variable ESS$cntbrthc):

```{r}
# table(ESS$cntbrthc)
library(dplyr)
uk <- filter(ESS, ESS$cntbrthc == "GB")
head(uk)
```


Let's describe relationships between the following pairs of variables: 

- `polintr` and `sgnptit` 

I expect to find out if there is a relationship between the level of political interest (polintr) and whether individuals support (sign petition for) any non-governmental organization (sgnptit).

```{r}
# create a contingency table
pol_sgnptit <- table(uk$polintr, uk$sgnptit)
pol_sgnptit

# run chi-square test
chisq.test(pol_sgnptit, correct=F)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)

pol_sgnptit_table <- as.table(pol_sgnptit)
balloonplot(pol_sgnptit_table, show.margins = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "`polintr` and `sgnptit`")


```

- `vote` and `gndr`

- `rlgblg` and `sgnptit`

- `domicil` and `gndr`

For every pair :

**1) write down what you expect to find out (research hypothesis);**

**2) run a statistical test**

**3) build a plot visualizing the relationship**

**4) describe the results and write your interpretation**




## Problem 2

You are trying for an internship at a retail company, and the interviewer asks you to evaluate whether the proportions of coloured M&M's in their latest supply are the same in blue and brown packages.

You are given the numbers for the frequencies of colours by package colour. You look closer at the data, ready for a test:

```{r mm-data}
brown <- c(26, 6, 12, 9, 12, 15)
blue <- c(14, 8, 11, 15, 15, 7)
data <- cbind(brown, blue)
colors <- c('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'brown')
sum(brown)
sum(blue)
rownames(data) <- colors
data
```

```{r another-test}
chisq.test(data, correct=F)
```

Later, you get an update to your data supply with some info on yellow-package M&M's. You need to update your dataset and run the test again, now on three colour.

![](2022-02-16.gif)

```{r data-update}
yellow <- c(9, 5, 6, 5, 1, 6)
new <- cbind(brown, blue, yellow)
colnames(new) <- c("brown", "blue", "yellow")
rownames(new) <- colors
new

```

```{r test-rerun}
chisq.test(new, correct=F)

```
```{r}
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(new, expected=T)
```


## Problem 3
Hotdogs vs. Hamburgers - which one would you prefer?

https://www.axios.com/hamburgers-more-patriotic-july-4-food-than-hotdogs-66066e0c-ee3c-40de-8ec7-3dc7e5ac9164.html

Reproduce the survey data and decide if there is any relationship between 
electoral behavior and opinion on 'the most American food'

```{r}
vote <- rbind(round(c(960/100*31, 840/100*39,  389/100*33), 0), # Hamburgers
              round(c(960/100*33, 840/100*29, 389/100*21), 0)) # Hotdogs
rownames(vote) <- c("Hamburgers", "Hotdogs")
colnames(vote) <- c("CLINTON VOTERS", "TRUMP VOTERS", "DIDN'T VOTE")
vote
```
```{r}
CrossTable(vote, expected=T)
```



Well done!
