## Problem 1: Are religious respondents more trustful to strangers?

Load the World Values Survey dataset on Russia (folder “data”, **WV6_Russia.sav**).

```{r}
library(haven)
WV6_Russia <- read_sav("~/0_teaching/DAS 2023/DAS 2023/data/WV6_Russia.sav")
WV6_Russia
```

Examine whether the answers to the following questions are associated: “Independently of whether you attend religious services or not, would you say you are a religious person?” `(V147)` and “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?” `(V24)`.

```{r}
WV1 <- WV6_Russia %>% select(`V147`, `V24`)
WV <- na.omit(WV1)
WV
```


First, visualize both variables independently, 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Bar plot for V147
ggplot(WV, aes(x = factor(V147))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Religious person", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Religious Person Variable")
# Bar plot for V24
ggplot(WV, aes(x = factor(V24))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Trust in people", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Trust in People Variable")
```

then plot them together to see the joint distribution, 

```{r}
# Stacked bar plot for both variables
ggplot(WV, aes(x = factor(V24), fill = factor(V147))) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(x = "Trust in people", y = "Count", title = "Joint Distribution of Religious Person and Trust in People Variables", fill = "Religious Person")
```

then run a formal test and interpret the results.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(WV$V147, WV$V24))
```



## Problem 2: Website A/B testing.

Load the data on testing the website appearance (folder “data”, **abtest.csv**).

```{r}
library(readr)
abtest <- read_csv("~/0_teaching/DAS 2023/DAS 2023/data/abtest.csv")
abtest
```

An online computer game site has tested a new version of game interface. The success is measured by the number of tokens that players earned during one session. A control group (A) of new players was shown the old interface, while a randomly selected sample of new players (B) was playing in a new interface.

Compare the two interfaces and make a conclusion whether the new interface was more successful in this experiment.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(abtest, aes(x = cond, y = tokens)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Interface", y = "Tokens earned", title = "Comparison of Tokens Earned by Interface")
```


```{r}
a <- abtest[abtest$cond == "A",]
a
b <- abtest[abtest$cond == "B",]
b
```


```{r}
shapiro.test(a$tokens)
shapiro.test(b$tokens)
var.test(a$tokens, b$tokens)
```
```{r}
t.test(b$tokens, a$tokens, paired=F, var.equal=F, alternative = "greater")
```



## Problem 3: Should you stare at gulls? 

![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2coVNpAZeYjBeNi7dcoCJ.jpg)

Greedy gulls stealing French fries (folder “data”, **gulldata.csv**)

A group of biologists has collected a data set to investigate whether seagulls take a longer time to steal food when someone is staring at them. 

For each gull, there are two observations: when a researcher was staring at it and when a researcher was looking away. In both conditions, the researchers measured the time before a seagull reaches a pack of French fries.

You need to decide which one is a better strategy to protect one's food - to stare at the seagulls or to look away while eating.

Visualize the difference in time, 

```{r}
gulldata <- read_csv("~/0_teaching/DAS 2023/DAS 2023/data/gulldata.csv")
gulldata
```

use a formal test to decide whether the difference is statistically significant, 

```{r}
shapiro.test(gulldata$away)
shapiro.test(gulldata$at)
var.test(gulldata$away, gulldata$at)
```

check the assumptions, 

```{r}
t.test(gulldata$away, gulldata$at, var.equal=T, alternative = "two.sided")
t.test(gulldata$away, gulldata$at, var.equal=T, alternative = "less")
```

and interpret the results.


```{r}
#install.packages("cowsay")
library(cowsay)
say(what="Well done! Be good people", 
    by = "behindcat", 
    type = "message")
```



THE END.
